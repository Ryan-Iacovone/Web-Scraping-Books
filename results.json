After all, the brain is a muscle too! My 18-month-old son and 4-year-old daughter love storytime because they associate it with dancing, singing and other sensory activities. Some storytimes even have a bubble machine dance session at the very end. Our favorite!\n\nStorytime also gives children a safe place to explore how to socialize with other children. From sharing toys and books to following directions, storytime is one of the first places my children began to see themselves as part of a larger group. I have seen both of my children become more self-aware — and more aware of others — through cooperative play at storytime. We can even stay and play in the [WonderKnook play spaces](https://kdl.org/wonderknook/)\n when storytime is over. \n\n**Storytime Encourages a Lifetime Love of Reading.**\n\nStorytime forms positive foundational memories with reading and the library, memories that may foster a lifelong love of reading. Why is this important to me? Because more and more studies show that reading is one of the better coping mechanisms for regulating emotion, reducing stress, improving cognitive performance and building empathy. A love of reading is one of the most important gifts I can give to my children. The good news is, it’s never too late to start giving it.\n\n**Storytime Won’t Send You Home Empty-Handed (Literally).**\n\nMost library storytimes end with a special craft based on the stories read that day. In my home right now, we are especially attached to a paper plate version of the hungry fish from Lo Cole’s [_Ten in a Hurry_](https://kdl.bibliocommons.com/v2/search?query=ten%20in%20a%20hurry&searchType=smart&_ga=2.259405059.807267999.1666194648-418718736.1624472264)\n. My daughter loves to use the plate to reenact how the big fish gulped all but one of the little fishes down and then burped them back up! In doing so, she is demonstrating important thinking skills like comprehension and retention. When she brings the “fish” into her play and has it eat (and burp up) her other toys, she is demonstrating application. These are skills she will build upon throughout her schooling and use for the rest of her life!\n\n**Storytime Is Economical.  \n**  \nMy local library is one of the few places I can go with my family and not be expected to spend money. Storytime is and will always be free and fun! Not to mention, it gives this tired mama a small break while my children are fully engaged in something other than a screen.\n\nStorytime also expands our literary horizons by introducing us to new subjects, stories and authors we may never have discovered otherwise — and we don’t have to break the bank to indulge these discoveries, either. Thanks to the library, we have been able to check out books en masse and read them over and over again and return them when we’re finished. Whenever my child moves on to something new, I feel good knowing these books are being read and enjoyed by other children in Kent County, rather than sitting idly on a shelf in my home.\n\n**Storytime Is for Everyone.  \n**  \nYes, everyone! It’s OK if your kids are a little wiggly (or a lot). It’s OK if you’re a few minutes late or if you don’t have a library card yet (get one!) or if your child woke up on the wrong side of the bed that morning. KDL now offers select [storytimes in American Sign Language](https://kdl.bibliocommons.com/v2/events?q=ASL)\n and [Spanish](https://kdl.bibliocommons.com/v2/events?q=Spanish)\n. For more sensitive participants or those who can't make it to the library for any reason, KDL offers [Storytime Anytime](https://kdl.org/sensorystorytime/)\n, available online. That’s the beauty of the library: it accepts everyone where they are and as they are. The library says, “You belong.” And where we find belonging, we find joy. Storytime is joy.\n\n**Check out [kdl.org/events](http://kdl.org/events)\n to see when and where there is a storytime near you!**\n\n[Find a Storytime](https://kdl.bibliocommons.com/v2/events?q=Storytime)\n   [American Sign Language Storytimes](https://kdl.bibliocommons.com/v2/events?q=ASL)\n  \n\n[Storytime Anytime](https://kdl.org/storytime-anytime/)\n   [Cuentos en Español / Spanish Storytime](https://kdl.bibliocommons.com/v2/events?q=Spanish)\n\nShare Links\n\n[Add a comment](#comments-section)\n\nMore by Katie\n-------------\n\n[![](https://d4804za1f1gw.cloudfront.net/wp-content/mu-plugins/biblioweb/assets/images/placeholder/card_2_1.png)](https://kdl.org/blogs/post/gather-2-grow-success/)\n\nClose\n\nOpen\n\n### [Gather 2 Grow Success](https://kdl.org/blogs/post/gather-2-grow-success/)\n\n*   [School Age](https://kdl.org/explore/?audience=school-age)\n    \n*   [Community Resources](https://kdl.org/explore/?topic=community-resources)\n    \n\n[![](https://d4804za1f1gw.cloudfront.net/wp-content/mu-plugins/biblioweb/assets/images/placeholder/card_2_1.png)](https://kdl.org/blogs/post/community-mental-health-and-kdl/)\n\nClose\n\nOpen\n\n### [Community, Mental Health and KDL](https://kdl.org/blogs/post/community-mental-health-and-kdl/)\n\n*   [Equity, Diversity & Inclusion](https://kdl.org/explore/?topic=equity-diversity-inclusion)\n    \n\n[![](https://d4804za1f1gw.cloudfront.net/wp-content/mu-plugins/biblioweb/assets/images/placeholder/card_2_1.png)](https://kdl.org/blogs/post/literacy-champion-spotlight-robin-trocinski/)\n\nClose\n\nOpen\n\n### [Literacy Champion Spotlight: Robin Trocinski](https://kdl.org/blogs/post/literacy-champion-spotlight-robin-trocinski/)\n\n*   [Adults](https://kdl.org/explore/?audience=adults)\n    \n\nDiscover New Posts\n------------------\n\n[![](https://d4804za1f1gw.cloudfront.net/wp-content/mu-plugins/biblioweb/assets/images/placeholder/card_2_1.png)](https://kdl.org/blogs/post/hoopla-changes/)\n\nClose\n\nOpen\n\n### [Important Notice of Changes to Our Hoopla Collection](https://kdl.org/blogs/post/hoopla-changes/)\n\n*   [Adults](https://kdl.org/explore/?audience=adults)\n    \n*   [Middle Graders](https://kdl.org/explore/?audience=middle-graders)\n    \n*   [School Age](https://kdl.org/explore/?audience=school-age)\n    \n*   [Seniors](https://kdl.org/explore/?audience=seniors)\n    \n*   [Teens](https://kdl.org/explore/?audience=teens)\n    \n\n[![](https://d4804za1f1gw.cloudfront.net/wp-content/mu-plugins/biblioweb/assets/images/placeholder/card_2_1.png)](https://kdl.org/blogs/post/important-notice-of-changes-to-overdrive-hold-limits/)\n\nClose\n\nOpen\n\n### [Important Notice of Changes to OverDrive Hold Limits](https://kdl.org/blogs/post/important-notice-of-changes-to-overdrive-hold-limits/)\n\n*   [Adults](https://kdl.org/explore/?audience=adults)\n    \n*   [Middle Graders](https://kdl.org/explore/?audience=middle-graders)\n    \n*   [School Age](https://kdl.org/explore/?audience=school-age)\n    \n*   [Seniors](https://kdl.org/explore/?audience=seniors)\n    \n*   [Teens](https://kdl.org/explore/?audience=teens)\n    \n\n[![](https://d4804za1f1gw.cloudfront.net/wp-content/mu-plugins/biblioweb/assets/images/placeholder/card_2_1.png)](https://kdl.org/blogs/post/your-invitation-to-storytime/)\n\nClose\n\nOpen\n\n### [Your Invitation to Storytime](https://kdl.org/blogs/post/your-invitation-to-storytime/)\n\n*   [Young Children](https://kdl.org/explore/?audience=young-children)\n    \n*   [Kaleidoscope Feature](https://kdl.org/explore/?tag=kaleidoscope)\n    \n\nAdd a comment to: Why My Family LOVES Storytime (And Yours Should Too)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe welcome your respectful and on-topic comments and questions in this limited public forum.

For this reason, we’ve assembled a list of tips to keep track of your kids in the library.\n\n**Be proactive.** Upon arriving in the library’s parking lot, preferably before your vehicle comes to a halt, tell your kids, “This isn’t going to be like last time. I need you to stay with me. We are just going to pick up our holds and head out.”  \n**Chance of success: 1/10** – Very few people can just pick up their holds and head out.\n\n**Stick together.** Before you leave home, throw some rope, duct tape or bungee cords into your library bag with your returns. Upon arriving at the library, literally tie/tape your children to yourself.  \n**Chance of success 3/10** – Movement may be difficult and there’s no guarantee you’ll make it inside the library, but you’ll know where your kids are at all times… at least until they wriggle out.\n\n**Bookmark-o Polo.** As soon as you lose track of your kids in the library (aka immediately after turning around to look at some interesting book on the new release table), shout, “Bookmark-o” and listen for your children to yell “Polo.” Follow the voices until your children have been found.  \n**Chance of success 3/10** – The problem here is that other patrons might think you are playing with them, thus they might yell “Polo” as well. Conversely, other patrons—and staff—might not take kindly to all the yelling in the library.\n\n**Up, up and away.** Stop by the dollar store and grab some helium balloons before heading to the library. Attach the balloons to your child’s waist via a belt loop or similar method. Make sure the balloon string is long enough so the balloon is visible above the book stacks.  \n**Chance of success 5/10** – Some dangers to be aware of: ceiling fans, other children who want a balloon for themselves, your unhappy kiddo when their balloon pops for no reason. Because that’s what balloons do.\n\n**Look in the 'Knook.** When all else fails, head to the library’s new WonderKnook play space.  \n**Chance of success 9/10** – These exciting, new, wooden play structures are part imaginative-freedom-zones, part child-interest magnets.\n\nShare Links\n\n[Add a comment](#comments-section)\n\nMore by Katie\n-------------\n\n[![](https://d4804za1f1gw.cloudfront.net/wp-content/mu-plugins/biblioweb/assets/images/placeholder/card_2_1.png)](https://kdl.org/blogs/post/gather-2-grow-success/)\n\nClose\n\nOpen\n\n### [Gather 2 Grow Success](https://kdl.org/blogs/post/gather-2-grow-success/)\n\n*   [School Age](https://kdl.org/explore/?audience=school-age)\n    \n*   [Community Resources](https://kdl.org/explore/?topic=community-resources)\n    \n\n[![](https://d4804za1f1gw.cloudfront.net/wp-content/mu-plugins/biblioweb/assets/images/placeholder/card_2_1.png)](https://kdl.org/blogs/post/community-mental-health-and-kdl/)\n\nClose\n\nOpen\n\n### [Community, Mental Health and KDL](https://kdl.org/blogs/post/community-mental-health-and-kdl/)\n\n*   [Equity, Diversity & Inclusion](https://kdl.org/explore/?topic=equity-diversity-inclusion)\n    \n\n[![](https://d4804za1f1gw.cloudfront.net/wp-content/mu-plugins/biblioweb/assets/images/placeholder/card_2_1.png)](https://kdl.org/blogs/post/literacy-champion-spotlight-robin-trocinski/)\n\nClose\n\nOpen\n\n### [Literacy Champion Spotlight: Robin Trocinski](https://kdl.org/blogs/post/literacy-champion-spotlight-robin-trocinski/)\n\n*   [Adults](https://kdl.org/explore/?audience=adults)\n    \n\nDiscover New Posts\n------------------\n\n[![](https://d4804za1f1gw.cloudfront.net/wp-content/mu-plugins/biblioweb/assets/images/placeholder/card_2_1.png)](https://kdl.org/blogs/post/hoopla-changes/)\n\nClose\n\nOpen\n\n### [Important Notice of Changes to Our Hoopla Collection](https://kdl.org/blogs/post/hoopla-changes/)\n\n*   [Adults](https://kdl.org/explore/?audience=adults)\n    \n*   [Middle Graders](https://kdl.org/explore/?audience=middle-graders)\n    \n*   [School Age](https://kdl.org/explore/?audience=school-age)\n    \n*   [Seniors](https://kdl.org/explore/?audience=seniors)\n    \n*   [Teens](https://kdl.org/explore/?audience=teens)\n    \n\n[![](https://d4804za1f1gw.cloudfront.net/wp-content/mu-plugins/biblioweb/assets/images/placeholder/card_2_1.png)](https://kdl.org/blogs/post/important-notice-of-changes-to-overdrive-hold-limits/)\n\nClose\n\nOpen\n\n### [Important Notice of Changes to OverDrive Hold Limits](https://kdl.org/blogs/post/important-notice-of-changes-to-overdrive-hold-limits/)\n\n*   [Adults](https://kdl.org/explore/?audience=adults)\n    \n*   [Middle Graders](https://kdl.org/explore/?audience=middle-graders)\n    \n*   [School Age](https://kdl.org/explore/?audience=school-age)\n    \n*   [Seniors](https://kdl.org/explore/?audience=seniors)\n    \n*   [Teens](https://kdl.org/explore/?audience=teens)\n    \n\n[![](https://d4804za1f1gw.cloudfront.net/wp-content/mu-plugins/biblioweb/assets/images/placeholder/card_2_1.png)](https://kdl.org/blogs/post/your-invitation-to-storytime/)\n\nClose\n\nOpen\n\n### [Your Invitation to Storytime](https://kdl.org/blogs/post/your-invitation-to-storytime/)\n\n*   [Young Children](https://kdl.org/explore/?audience=young-children)\n    \n*   [Kaleidoscope Feature](https://kdl.org/explore/?tag=kaleidoscope)\n    \n\nAdd a comment to: Impossible Task\n---------------------------------\n\nWe welcome your respectful and on-topic comments and questions in this limited public forum.
