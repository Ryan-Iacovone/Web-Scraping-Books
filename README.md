# Web Scraping Book Details

Scraping basic information about popular books from the web. Used staff lists to identify books to scrape. 

Then I built a program to take a list of staff lists as input and extract all relevant book info from each list.

Saved the output as an excel sheet that can be easily updated upon each run of the program
